# Critical Supabase Key Issue Fix

## ⚠️ URGENT: Wrong Supabase Key Type Detected

Your `.env.local` file contains what appears to be a **service role key** instead of the **anon public key**.

### Current Issue
The key in your `.env.local` file is very long and likely contains `service_role` in its JWT payload. This type of key:
- Should NEVER be used in frontend applications
- Can cause authentication issues
- Is a security risk if exposed

### Fix Required

1. **Go to your Supabase project dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Settings → API**
3. **Copy the correct keys:**

```bash
# Use these values in your .env.local file:

# Project URL (this looks correct)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://hfpmmjvdsdofheuffnwb.supabase.co

# ANON PUBLIC KEY (NOT service_role key!)
# Should look like: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InlvdXJfcmVmIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE2NDQyNTc...
# Notice it contains "anon" in the role, NOT "service_role"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_public_key_here
```

### How to Get the Correct Key

1. In Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
2. Look for the section labeled **"Project API keys"**
3. Copy the key labeled **"anon public"** (NOT "service_role")
4. The anon key should be shorter and safe for frontend use

### Visual Guide

In your Supabase dashboard, you should see:
```
Project API keys
├── anon public    ← USE THIS ONE
└── service_role   ← NEVER use in frontend
```

### After Fixing

1. Update your `.env.local` file with the correct anon public key
2. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Test the login functionality again

### Why This Matters

- **Service role keys** have admin privileges and should only be used server-side
- **Anon public keys** are designed for frontend use and have proper security restrictions
- Using the wrong key can cause authentication failures and security issues

### Quick Test

After updating the key, open your browser console and look for:
```
Supabase connection test successful
```

If you see connection errors, the key is still incorrect.
