# User Logout Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: User logout does not work

### What was fixed:

1. **Enhanced signOut function** in `useAuth.ts`:
   - Added proper error handling and logging
   - Clear local state immediately after successful logout
   - Return proper error object

2. **Improved Header logout handling**:
   - Created dedicated `handleSignOut` function
   - Added navigation redirect after successful logout
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Proper menu state cleanup

3. **Added debugging logs** to identify where the logout process might fail

### To test the fix:

1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab** to see debug messages
3. **Sign in** to your account
4. **Click Sign Out** button (either in desktop dropdown or mobile menu)
5. **Check console logs** for the following messages:
   - "Header: Starting sign out..."
   - "Starting sign out process..."
   - "Supabase signOut successful, clearing local state..."
   - "Sign out completed successfully"
   - "Header: Sign out successful, closing menus and redirecting..."

### Expected behavior after fix:

1. **Immediate feedback**: User sees console logs indicating logout progress
2. **State clearing**: User object, session, and profile are set to null
3. **Menu closure**: Dropdowns close automatically
4. **Redirect**: User is redirected to home page (/)
5. **UI update**: Header shows "Sign In" button instead of user menu

### If logout still doesn't work:

Check console for error messages:

1. **Supabase errors**: Look for "Supabase signOut error"
2. **Network errors**: Check Network tab for failed requests
3. **Environment issues**: Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct

### Common causes and solutions:

1. **Network issues**: 
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Supabase service status

2. **Configuration issues**:
   - Ensure `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
   - Verify Supabase project is active

3. **Browser issues**:
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try in incognito/private mode
   - Try different browser

4. **Session persistence**:
   - Check if localStorage/sessionStorage is being cleared
   - Verify Supabase auth configuration

### Manual debugging steps:

1. **Open browser console**
2. **Type**: `localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear();`
3. **Refresh page**
4. **Try logging in and out again**

### Code changes made:

#### `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`:
- Enhanced `signOut()` function with better error handling
- Added console logging for debugging
- Immediate local state clearing

#### `src/components/Header.tsx`:
- Added `useNavigate` hook
- Created `handleSignOut()` function
- Updated both desktop and mobile sign out buttons
- Added redirect to home page after logout

The logout functionality should now work reliably with proper error handling and user feedback.
