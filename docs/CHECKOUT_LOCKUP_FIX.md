# Checkout Lockup Fix

## Problem
The checkout page was locking up (becoming unresponsive) when users clicked the checkout button.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an infinite re-render loop in the `Checkout.tsx` component:

1. The `validateForm()` function was being called directly in the `disabled` prop of payment components
2. `validateForm()` contained side effects (calling `showToast()` to display error messages)
3. When form validation failed, `showToast()` would trigger a state update
4. State updates caused the component to re-render
5. On re-render, `validateForm()` was called again, creating an infinite loop

```tsx
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (BEFORE):
<StripePayment
  disabled={!validateForm()}  // ðŸš¨ Called on every render, triggers side effects
/>

const validateForm = (): boolean => {
  // ... validation logic ...
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    showToast({  // ðŸš¨ Side effect causes re-render
      type: 'error',
      title: 'Missing Information',
      message: `Please fill in: ${missing.join(', ')}`
    })
    return false
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Solution
Split the validation function into two separate functions:

1. **`isFormValid()`** - Pure function without side effects for determining disabled state
2. **`validateForm()`** - Function with user feedback for explicit validation (removed since not needed)

```tsx
// FIXED CODE (AFTER):
<StripePayment
  disabled={!isFormValid()}  // âœ… Pure function, no side effects
/>

const isFormValid = (): boolean => {
  const required = ['firstName', 'lastName', 'email', 'address', 'city', 'state', 'zipCode']
  const missing = required.filter(field => !customerInfo[field as keyof CustomerInfo])
  
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    return false  // âœ… No side effects
  }

  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
  if (!emailRegex.test(customerInfo.email)) {
    return false  // âœ… No side effects
  }

  return true
}
```

## Additional Improvements
- Added extra validation in `handlePaymentSuccess()` to ensure form is valid before processing
- Enhanced error handling with more descriptive error messages
- Ensured payment components are properly disabled when form is invalid

## Key Principle
**Never call functions with side effects in render-dependent code** like props, computed values, or anything that gets called on every render. Use pure functions for these cases and only trigger side effects in response to user actions (event handlers).
