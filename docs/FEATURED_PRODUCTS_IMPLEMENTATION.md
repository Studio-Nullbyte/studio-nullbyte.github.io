# Featured Products Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Added getFeaturedProducts function to supabase.ts
- Added a new function to fetch featured products from the database
- Includes related category information and ratings
- Supports limit parameter (default: 3)
- Returns products marked as `featured: true` and `active: true`

### 2. Updated Home.tsx component
- Replaced static featured products array with dynamic data fetching
- Added React hooks for state management (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Implemented loading, error, and empty states
- **Added conditional rendering**: Featured Products section is hidden when no products exist
- Updated rendering logic to use database field names:
  - `product.image` ‚Üí `product.image_url`
  - `product.category` ‚Üí `product.categories.name`
  - `product.price` ‚Üí `$${product.price}`
- Added error handling for image loading failures
- **"View All Products" link only shows when featured products exist**

### 3. Database Schema
- Uses existing `products` table with `featured` boolean column
- Joins with `categories` table for category information
- Includes `tags` array for product tags
- Uses `image_url` for product images

### 4. Loading States
- Loading spinner while fetching data
- Error message with retry button
- Empty state with link to browse all products
- Fallback images for missing product images

### 5. Sample Data
- Created `sample-featured-products.sql` with sample data
- Includes categories and featured products
- Ready to run in Supabase SQL editor

## Usage

The featured products will now automatically load from the database when the home page loads. 

### Conditional Rendering Behavior:
- **Section Hidden**: If no featured products exist, the entire Featured Products section is hidden
- **Loading State**: Section shows with loading spinner while fetching data
- **Error State**: Section shows with error message and retry button if fetching fails
- **Success State**: Section shows with products when data loads successfully

### Adding Featured Products:

1. Add products to the `products` table
2. Set `featured: true` and `active: true`
3. Ensure the product has a valid `category_id`
4. The product will automatically appear on the home page

### Removing Featured Products:
- Set `featured: false` or `active: false` on all products
- The Featured Products section will be completely hidden from the home page

## Environment Variables Required

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key

### Fallback Behavior
If these environment variables are not set:
- The `getFeaturedProducts` function will return an empty array immediately
- The Featured Products section will be hidden (no loading spinner)
- A warning message will be logged to the console
- The app will continue to work normally without database features

### Troubleshooting Loading Issues
If the loading spinner shows indefinitely:
1. Check that environment variables are properly set
2. Verify Supabase project URL and anon key are correct
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure the `products` table exists in your Supabase database
